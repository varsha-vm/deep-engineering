# Indexing in SQL
- Indexing is a data structure creayed by SQL developers to make the query execution faster.
- Indexing create a copy on data and uses seperate disk space to hold  indexed data, hence it can be redundant.
- Real life example would be the index available on back of every book with page numbers.
- Indexing make query execution easier as everything is ordered just like content in yellow pages or telephone directory.
- Indexing under the hood is build using two data structures such as doubly linked list & BST tree.
- Indexing is expensive and hard, due to underlying data changes such as insert, update & delete will have to make changes to existing data position in place.
